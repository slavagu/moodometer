# moodometer - team mood tracker

A simple app to capture team mood and see how it changes over time.

> This is a demo project showing how to create a serverless app in a few simple steps, inspired by https://serverless-stack.com

The app is built with React and NodeJS.

The API uses AWS API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB and is deployed with serverless.com framework.

To run both UI and API in a local dev environment: `npm run dev`

> NOTE The API will use default aws profile to access DynamoDB in the cloud
