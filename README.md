# moodometer - team mood tracker

A simple app to capture team mood and see how it changes over time.

> This is a demo project showing how to create a serverless app in a few simple steps, inspired by https://serverless-stack.com

The app is built with React and NodeJS.

The API hosted in AWS and uses API Gateway / Lambda / DynamoDB and is deployed with serverless.com framework.

To run both UI and API in a local dev environment: `npm i && npm run dev`

> NOTE The API will use default aws profile to access DynamoDB in the cloud
